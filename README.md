Sure. Here's a more natural, **humanized** English version of the `README.md` for your project **Realm C2**, using casual language and common expressions developers use on GitHub:

# Realm C2

Realm C2 is a command-and-control (C2) tool built for testing and stress simulation on Minecraft Bedrock servers and Realms. It lets you spin up multiple fake clients, hit servers with different packet types, and even monitor player data like beds, deaths, and teleport locations.

This tool is meant for **testing, research, and fun in controlled environments**. Don’t be that guy using this on random servers.

---

## Features

- Attack any Bedrock server or Realm (invite code or IP:port)
- Tons of prebuilt attack modes (lag, crash, freeze, XP spam, etc.)
- Ghost mode to simulate stealth clients (hidden tablist)
- Tracks players: beds, last death, dimension, permissions
- Interactive terminal with attack history
- Built-in random spoofed names and UUIDs
- Multi-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac with Node.js)

---

## Setup

Clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/realm-c2.git
cd realm-c2
npm install
````

You’ll also need a valid Xbox Live account saved under `./test` using [prismarine-auth](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-auth).

---

## Running It

```bash
node --no-deprecation index.js
```

Once it's running, you’ll see a prompt like:

```
[C2]>>
```

From there, you can start launching attacks or scanning Realms.

---

## Basic Usage

```
<method> <realm_code OR host:port> <client_count> <duration_in_seconds> <ghost_mode:false>
```

### Examples

```bash
crash2 M88VBukXcn9G4HY 40 25 true
freeze 127.0.0.1:19132 10 60 false
```

---

## Built-in Commands

You can type these inside the C2 terminal:

* `clear` – clears the screen
* `lastattacks` – shows all recent attacks
* `runattack <id>` – repeats a past attack by ID

---

## Available Methods

```text
crash, crash2, crash3 ... crash13  
lag1, lag2  
freeze, blind, blindmodedick  
xp, find
```

These methods hit servers with different packet floods, behavior triggers, or tracking logic. Play around to see what each one does. Most of them loop aggressively for `duration` seconds per client.

---

## Ghost Mode

Passing `true` as the 5th argument enables ghost mode. The first bot will log in and instantly quit, freeing up the player slot but keeping the “session” active in some servers — useful for Realms that are full or restrict joins.

---

## Packaging into Executable

Optional, but if you want to ship a binary:

```bash
npm install -g pkg
pkg index.js --targets node18-win-x64,node18-linux-x64,node18-macos-x64
```

---

## Heads-Up

This tool is for **educational and testing purposes only**. Don't run this on public or private servers without permission — you might break stuff and get into trouble. I'm not responsible for what you do with it.
